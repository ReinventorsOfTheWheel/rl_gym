# Reinforcement learning

This repository collects implementations for common reinforcement learning algorithms.
I'm trying to follow a uniform architecture across the algorithms, this should allow easy comparisons and extensions.

Please note: This repository is very much work-in-progress. Some of the implementations seem stable,
but they could all do with more testing. 

### implemented:
 - DQN
 - DDQN
 - A3C
 
### roadmap:
 - A3C with experience replay
