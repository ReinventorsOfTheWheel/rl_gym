### Go on, nothing to see here :)

The structure I would like to have throughout the repository can be seen for PPO.

This means setting up different models for the different types of environments and moving that code out of brain.
It's done for PPO and pretty much ready for A3C, but not for DQN yet.

So to play around with a different model and DQN, I duplicated the code.
