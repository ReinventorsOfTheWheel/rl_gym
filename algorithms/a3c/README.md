# Go on, nothing to see here

This is a first A3C implementation for the cartpole openAI problem.
So far I kept it as a reference. But when I have refactored the model out of A3C, I'll delete this code.

My up-to-date A3C implementation is in the A3C-env folder.

this code is heavily influenced by https://github.com/jaara/AI-blog
